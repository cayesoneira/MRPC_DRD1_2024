# MRPC_DRD1_2024: Multigap Resistive Plate Chambers Data Analysis and HV Scan

Welcome to the **MRPC_DRD1_2024** repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive tool for **Lab 6.B: MRPC Characterization**, part of the **DRD1 Gaseous Detectors School** at CERN (November 27â€“December 6, 2024). It includes all the resources required to conduct the session, focusing on the analysis of MRPC data and high voltage (HV) scans.

The [documentation page of the detector](http://nuc1.fis.ucm.es/minitrasgo/) includes instructions on several functions as the HV modification commands, for example.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **[MRPC_DRD1_LAB.ipynb](MRPC_DRD1_LAB.ipynb)**
   - **Purpose**: A guided Google Colab notebook designed to streamline the session.
   - **Features**:
     - Step-by-step instructions for analyzing MRPC data.
     - Code snippets for generating histograms and performance plots.
     - Tools for calibrating and characterizing the mini-telescope.

   - **Usage**: Open the notebook in **Google Colab**, and integrate it with Google Drive for seamless access to the `DATA` directory. No downloads or installations are needed on your local machine.

### 2. **DATA/**
   - **Purpose**: Contains the experimental data files in `.txt` format.
   - **Content**: Pre-collected datasets for HV scan, efficiency calculation, and other key metrics.
   - **Usage**: The notebook automatically loads these files for analysis. Ensure the `DATA` directory is synced to your Google Drive.

## Session Overview: Lab 6.B - MRPC Characterization

### **Introduction**
The aim of this session is to characterize a **mini-telescope** composed of four MRPC planes. Students will:
- Analyze the telescopeâ€™s efficiency, charge spectrum, background rate, streamer probability, and time resolution as a function of HV.
- Perform charge and time calibrations.

No advanced Python skills are required. The session is beginner-friendly and guided through provided notebooks.

### **Experimental Setup**
- **Telescope Design**: Four MRPC planes enclosed in sealed gas-tight plastic boxes, with feed-throughs for gas and HV connections.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Electrodes**: Made of 2 mm float glass, separated by nylon mono-filaments.
  - **Readout System**: High-speed electronics encode time and charge with precision better than 30 ps and 100 ns, respectively.
  - **DAQ System**: Uses TRB3sc for time processing, with time precision under 20 ps.
- **Gas**: Operates with pure R134a.
- **HV**: Optimal operation at ~5.4 kV per gap.

### **Work Plan**
1. **Introduction** (30 min)
   - Overview of the mini-telescope and software.
   - Setup and control instructions.

2. **Data Acquisition and Analysis** (3 hours)
   - Run HV scans (~30 minutes per voltage point).
   - Generate and analyze histograms (charge, time, position).
   - Study angular distributions.

3. **Final Plots** (30 min)
   - Produce efficiency, charge spectrum, streamer probability, background rate, and time resolution plots.
